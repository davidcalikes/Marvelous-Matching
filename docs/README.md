## Planning & Development

- __Project Inception__

    I have always had an innate, practical understanding of computing and technology. Having worked within the field of Special Education for the last 15 years I often feel and act upon a sense of duty to assist pupils and collegues who are having difficulty operating and integrating assitive technologies.

    Marvelous Matching, was developed in response to the following technical challenges faced by the teachers and pupils of St Mary's Special School, Drumcar, Co Louth. Eire - my current place of work: <br> 
    
    1. Software reliant on the defunct adobe flash player is now no longer functional.
    2. A significant number of pupils with physical and learning disabilities find most early-learning applications too difficult to interact with.
    3. There are currently no free resources available that offer pupils the chance to match multiple categories within a single application.
    4. There are no resources available that are compatible across multiple platforms. 
    
    
    <br>

    
- __Planning Statement__

    A matching game called 'Marvelous Matching' will be developed to address the issues stated above.

    Marvelous Matching will be a user friendly application that is easy to use and navigate.

    The application will be free to use and functional across multiple devices, browsers and operating systems. 

    The site will help children achieve thier educational goals by addressing key stage learning outcomes.  
    
    The site will offer a stimulating and rewarding library of custom sounds to enhance the users educational experience. 
    
    These sounds will be user controlled and promote interaction and engagement.

    The game will offer users a choice of three separate categories: ‘Animals’, ‘Shapes’, and ‘Colours’ as well as a choice of two game modes: 'Learning' and 'Test'. 
     
- __Target Audience__

    <img src="./readme_images/learning_outcomes.png">
_Example of just one of the many curriculum links targeted by Marvelous Matching._

<br>

After consultation with St Mary's Class 5 teacher Caoimhe Brady, we reached the conclusion that matching games are an important resource in helping pupils of all ages within our school achieve the following (Irish Curriculum) learning outcomes:

* Learning Goals.
    * Sorting & Matching
    * Matching Identical Objects.
    * Recognising 'same' and 'different'.
    * Observing 2-dimensional shapes.
    * Recognising irregular shapes (star, oval, ect.)
    * Expanding vocabulary. (shape names, colour names, animal, names ect.)
    * Recognising sounds.

    <br>

    Whilst the catalyst for the development of Marvelous Matching was due to the exigent needs of the pupils of St Mary's Special School, the site may also prove useful to users outwith special education environments.

    Many parents with young toddlers may also find the application useful for [pre-school learning](https://toysoldier.fun/blogs/just-sharing/benefits-of-playing-matching-games-activities).

    <img src="./readme_images/matching_benefits.png">

    Many elderly patients suffering with the effects of [late-stage dementia](https://hospitalnews.com/activities-and-games-for-patients-with-alzheimers-disease/#:~:text=You%20can%20help%20slow%20the,%2C%20functional%2C%20and%20physical%20abilities.) can also benefit from simple matching games.

- __Wireframes__ 

    Desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes were created using Balsamiq software to give a general overview of the layout of the site and to help organise the content logically. An image is posted of the gamepage wireframes below. I thought it unnecessary to create a framework for each game as the layout does not change for each category. A link to the full set of wireframes is available below.

    * [Set of site wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/home_wf.pdf) 
    
    <br>

   <img src="./readme_images/wireframe_gamepage.png">
   
   <br>
    The site conforms to the general layout of these frames and only deviates with respect to styling and content. 
<br>

- __Color Scheme__

    * The background gradient. (#ffffff, #80c7f0, #ffffff)
    
    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme1.png">

    The background gradient used is a standard style prevelent throughout early learning environments. Calming, like a clear blue sky, the background presents a contrasting perspective for the content of the game area and is not distracting.
    
    <img src="./readme_images/wiggles_background.png">

    _Example of blue-white background gradient in other early-learning media._

     <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme2.png"> #1d5cc9;
     <br>

    * The light blue colored elements of the site contain helpful and informative white text content to guide the user.

    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme3.png"> #ff0000.
    <br>

    * The red color indicates the question button than can be pressed for an audible clue.
    
    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme4.png"> #42526e
    <br>


     * The darker blue colour is used for navigation links. (This color was also featured on the website of St Mary's School so I used it here as it may provide reassurance as a color some users are familiar with)
     
     <br>


     <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme5.png"> #ffff00

    * I tried to avoid using explicit primary and secondary colors as much as possible. This is to avoid any potential confusion for users playing the colours matching game but I made an exeption with yellow, as i felt it provided the best contrast and impact for the elements I have targeted with the hover psuedo class.
    
    <br>

    Due to the educational nature of the site and how the content contains multiple vibrant colors I have only included colors used relative to the design of the site framework or those that provide user feedback through consistency of use.
 
   <br>
- __Typography__

*  There are two fonts used throughout the application.

    * Schoobell: A fun handwriting font that suits the playful style of the application.
   
    * Helvetica: A clear, professional font is used in the footer for developer information and copyright text.

    The fonts were imported to the stylesheet via Google fonts.

    <br>

- __Possible Future Features__

    For copyright reasons, it was not possible for me to integrate content from the Phonics and Maths programmes used within the school. Because of this, I did not include any numbers or letter matching categories. It was the consencus of teaching staff that using images or sounds that didn't match the current programmes would be confusing for the pupils. 

    In future versions of Marvelous Matching however, it may be possible to include a feature that allows teachers and support staff to upload content to the game themselves. This would mean that they could use the appropriate literature for each category and be able to teach even more learning outcomes from a single application.

    I would also like to add an Irish language translator feature at some point that would present the site in Irish.

    # Testing

- __Testing During Development__
 
* Responsiveness testing 

    
    I tested the responsivness of the application during the development phase using using the following:

    * Promethean Activboard Interactive Whiteboard. (Firefox for Android)
    <img src="./readme_images/promethean1.png">

    * HP Pavillion Notebook x360 serving a
    Smart Technologies SB-480 Interactive Whiteboard.

    * Mac Pro with a 21" Apple Cinema display -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Macbook pro 13" -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Toshiba Satellite Pro Laptop 15" (Windows 10) -- Edge, Chrome and Firefox

    * Apple iPad Mini (5th gen) -- Safari and Chrome
    <img src="./readme_images/ipad_mini.png">

    * Apple iPad (2nd gen -- Safari)
    <img src="./readme_images/old_ipad.png">

    * Huawei P20 Pro Android Phone -- Chrome and Firefox.

    * Various android tablet devices.
    <img src="./readme_images/android_tablet.png">

    I also used Google Dev-tools to test the sites responsivness by emulating the sites appearance across other device screen sizes.

    <img src="./readme_images/dev_tools.png">

    At the time of testing, the site was fully responsive across Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers on all of the above devices with the exeption of the following:

    * The Promethean Activboard would not display box items correctly in the Chromium web browser.

    * The site would not load box images or display correctly on the older iPad2 running ios 9.

    * The site is not practically useable on mobile devices in landscape mode.

    <br>

- __Style Error__

    <img src="./readme_images/android_phone.png">

    One of the first rendering errors I came across was an error that caused the drop-shadow filter effect to break on mobile devices.

    After searching for a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65801487/drop-shadow-not-working-properly-on-ios-safari) I fixed this issue by using a box-shadow effect instead.

    <br>

- __Feature Testing__

    I first tested each individual feature of the first Nav section of the menu page.

    * Sound Toggle

The Sound Toggle feature of the site threw up a few issues during development. Initially the switch functioned correctly on each page with the default setting of: OFF to enhance user experience. 

A problem arose however when users would navigate to a different page of the site. The Sound Toggle would return to the default OFF position.

Whilst it remains good UX design for default sound settings to be muted when the application first loads, I realised this would become tiresome and lead to a poor user experience if they had to constantly keep changing the switch state to achieve their desired sound setting. 

I found a solution to this problem on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMs0rn6kwM). By saving string data to Local Storage I was able to call a function that set the sound toggle depending on the data contained within said Local Storage. I was also able to maintain a default mute position by using the null keyword. 

<img src="./readme_images/sound_log.png">

I logged the string data from Local Storage to the console using Google Dev Tools to test this function during development. 

Despite this appearing to solve this problem, the console returned another error with the sound toggle as I added more features to the site.

<img src="./readme_images/q_button_error.png">

When I added a fontawesome speaker icon to the question button of each game page (to visual provide feedback for the user), I came across the following error.

<img src="./readme_images/snd_tgl_err1.png">

A problem was reported to the console when users would visit the menu page or about page as the Sound Toggle function would target an element that did not exist on these pages.

<img src="./readme_images/snd_tgl_err2.png">

I resolved this issue by including an element on each page (pictured above) and set the display style property to 'none'

<br>

*  Main Menu Buttons Testing

I had initially intended to have a simple sound function that would play a sound when a click event called it from the DOM. I encountered a problem however when using sounds when loading pages, the pages would often load and clip the sound before it is heard or sometimes it might not be heard at all. 

I fixed this error by developing a function that loads each page only after the sound effect has ended.

* About page Testing

I tested the link to the about page on the menu page and it opened at the correct destination. The About page nav links work, images load and the text content is free from gramattical errors.

* Footer Testing

The footer meets accessibility contrast and title attribute requirements. Both links work and open in a new browser tag. The footer was tested across all site pages.

* Game Page Testing

I encountered and overcame many errors and bugs during the development of the game page.

<br>
    
<img src="./readme_images/typo_error.png">

* Typo Errors

    * The first typo error I encountered provided the question button with the wrong animal type when playing the animals matching game. 
    (pictured above)

    * <img src="./readme_images/typo1_cause.png">

    * I found the offending error in the if else statements of the rungame function and corrected it.

    * The second typo error I found was playing the colours matching game. The Thumbnail image provided no audible user feedback.

    <img src="./readme_images/thumb_blue_error.png">

    * This error was solved by changing the capitalisation error pictured here.

    <br>

- __Test Mode Errors__

I encountered a few tricky errors when the test mode function was applied to the game. 

<img src="./readme_images/maketen_error.png">

<br>

* Attempts Error

    * When developing the test mode function of the game I created a rule that when ten attempts had been reached the Test Mode Congratulations Modal Would appear and provide the user with a final score. 

    * The error I discovered via testing was that the Test modal would fire even when the game was not in test mode.

    * I solved this problem by adding a second condition to the "tenCheck" JavaScript Function". (pictured above)

* Error in Shapes Game -- Test Mode
    
    * When developing the test mode function of the shapes game I discovered an error where the game would not refresh the flash card box elements when the test mode function was called.

    * <img src="./readme_images/shapes_test_error.png">

    * I found the issue here was a rougue space in the inner html of the element the JavaScript code was targeting. (facepalm emoji)

    * <img src="./readme_images/shapes_test_solved.png">

    <br>

* Further Testing of The Game Page
    
    * I tested each of the nav elements of every Game Page and each element functions properly.

    * I created the following test sequence for rigorous testing of all box elements across all game categories and modes.

    * The testing sequence is as follows:
        
        * Each box is clicked 10 times (To test for repeat of tenCheck function error)

        * The score will be logged for each box out of 10 in both game modes

        * Question Button and Thumbnail image results will be logged out of forty if they render correctly, match each other and match the correct box image every time.

        * Box Errors and Lower Game section errors will be logged in an errors section underneath the table.

The results of sequence testing returned no errors.

* <img src="./readme_images/rainbow.png">
* The Pupils used the application on the interactive whiteboard and android tablet.
* The application is accessible for all of the pupils to use.
* Marvelous Matching is great fun and the voice sounds are 'adorable'.

<br>

Declan's Class:

* The Pupils enjoyed Marvelous Matching.
* One of the pupils tried to swipe the images instead of tapping.
* The Pupils enjoyed using the application on the interactive whiteboard.
* A staff member commented on the convenience of being able to switch category within the one site.
* The application was inclusive and of great benefit to two children in particular who cannot swipe the whiteboard due to their physical disabilities.
* <img src="./readme_images/declans.png">
* The Start Game Modal was confusing. Both pupils and support staff tried to push the rules images to start the game.
* The Pupils mostly enjoyed the animals game and loved the audio elements.

<br>

- __More Manual Testing__

* Test subject: My son Lochlainn Calikes  
* Age: 7 months

Lochlainn loved looking at the app and passively enjoying the sounds, colours and biting the corner of the tablet. :)

<br>

- __Changes Made After Manual Testing__

<img src="./readme_images/old_animal_modal.png">

I decided to make the start game modal more intuitive to use by changing the instructional images to be less prominent and similar to that of the actual start game button.

<img src="./readme_images/new_animal_modal.png">

I achieved this by adding a grayscale filter to the images that were confusing to the user and removing the box-shadow effect to make them more 2 dimensional and less functional.

<br>

In response to the feedback from The Rainbow class, I have changes the pink Colours game flashcard to a lighter shade to make it easier to distinguish from the purple image

<br>

- __Validator Testing__

I ran all of the sites pages through the W3C validator and each page returned multiple errors.

<img src="./readme_images/html_val_errors.png">


I corrected the code and all pages now return no html errors.

<img src="./readme_images/index_val_passed.png">

* The CSS stylesheet was passed through the Jigsaw Validator and returned no errors.

<img src="./readme_images/css_pass.png">

* The JavaScript .js file was passed through the JSHINT validator and returned multiple warnings.

<img src="./readme_images/jshint_errors.png">

I altered the code and all pages now return no warnings.

<img src="./readme_images/jshint_val.png">

<br>

- __Performance Testing__

    I then used the WCAG color contrast checker tool and it returned one contrast error with the green button colour of the menu page.

    <img src="./readme_images/contrast_error.png">

    This was addressed by implementing a darker green colour for the menu buttons.

    <img src="./readme_images/contrast_error.png">

    I used the WCAG tool extensively throughout the site and made changes accordingly.

The WGAC contrast checker now returns just one error that I have laid out below

As you can see from these images, the intermittant error is related to the animated text link above the modal icon and the error is simply a limitation of the WCAG checkers functionality. I feel this is an warning I can safely ignore.

<img src="./readme_images/anim_error.png">

The site now achieves a 100% accessibility rating when tested through lighthouse and achieves almost perfect ratings for performance, search engine optimisation and best practices.

- __Fixed Bugs__

I originally used this [method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlwSz2dXK_8) of adding audio to the site however the audio content would often clip before it had finished playing. 

I solved this issue by referring to this article on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45330912/why-wont-my-button-play-my-sound-and-go-to-the-link)

<br>

- __Unfixed Bugs__

* Audio bug

There is an intermittant audio bug that occurs when a user interacts with an audio feature via some ios mobile devices. 

Initially the audio will play as normal but will not play the same audio file again properly until after 3 or 4 seconds. Even though it doesn't affect the operation in a special educational setting (as users would normally require time to consider their answers), I am still trying to find a solution to this issue that appears to be widely known as a fault within the ios operating system.

<br>

- __Other Known Bugs__

There are currently no other known bugs, but I will add them to this section in the future if and when they appear.
