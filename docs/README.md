## Planning & Development

- __Project Inception__

    I have always had an innate, practical understanding of computing and technology. Having worked within the field of Special Education for the last 15 years I often feel and act upon a sense of duty to assist pupils and collegues who are having difficulty operating and integrating assitive technologies.

    Marvelous Matching, was developed in response to the following technical challenges faced by the teachers and pupils of St Mary's Special School, Drumcar Co Louth. Eire - my current place of work: <br> 
    
    1. Software reliant on the defunct adobe flash player is now no longer functional.
    2. A significant number of pupils with physical and learning disabilities find most early-learning applications too difficult to interact with.
    3. There are currently no free resources available that offer pupils the chance to match multiple categories within a single application.
    4. There are no resources available that are compatible across multiple platforms. 
    
    
    <br>

    
- __Planning Statement__

    A matching game called 'Marvelous Matching' will be developed to address the issues stated above.

    Marvelous Matching will be a user friendly application that is easy to use and navigate.

    The application will be free to use and functional across multiple devices, browsers and operating systems. 

    The site will help children achieve thier educational goals by addressing key stage learning outcomes.  
    
    The site will offer a stimulating and rewarding library of custom sounds to enhance the users educational experience. 
    
    These sounds will be user controlled and promote interaction and engagement.

    The game will offer users a choice of three separate categories: ‘Animals’, ‘Shapes’, and ‘Colours’ as well as a choice of two game modes: 'Learning' and 'Test'. 
     
- __Target Audience__

    <img src="./readme_images/learning_outcomes.png">
_Example of just one of the many curriculum links targeted by Marvelous Matching._

<br>

After consultation with St Mary's Class 5 teacher Caoimhe Brady, we reached the conclusion that matching games are an important resource in helping pupils of all ages within our school achieve the following (Irish Corriculum) learning outcomes:

* Learning Goals.
    * Sorting & Matching
    * Matching Identical Objects.
    * Recognising 'same' and 'different'.
    * Observing 2 dimensional shapes.
    * Recognising irregular shapes (star, oval)
    * Expanding vocabulary. (shape names, colour names, animal, names ect.)
    * Recognising sounds

    <br>

    Whilst the catalyst for the development of Marvelous Matching was due to the exigent needs of the pupils of St Mary's Special School, the site may also prove useful to users outwith special education environments.

    Many parents with young toddlers may also find the application useful for [pre-school learning](https://toysoldier.fun/blogs/just-sharing/benefits-of-playing-matching-games-activities).

    <img src="./readme_images/matching_benefits.png">

    Many elderly patients suffering with the effects of [late-stage dementia](https://hospitalnews.com/activities-and-games-for-patients-with-alzheimers-disease/#:~:text=You%20can%20help%20slow%20the,%2C%20functional%2C%20and%20physical%20abilities.) can also benefit from simple matching games.

- __Wireframes__ 

    Desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes were created using Balsamiq software to give a general overview of the layout of the site and to help organise the content logically. An image is posted of the gamepage wireframes below. I thought it unnecessary to create a framework for each game as the layout does not change for each category. A link to the full set of wireframes is available below.

    * [Set of site wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/home_wf.pdf) 
    
    <br>

   <img src="./readme_images/wireframe_gamepage.png">
   
   <br>
    The site conforms to the general layout of these frames and only deviates with respect to styling and content. 
<br>

- __Color Scheme__

    * The background gradient. (#ffffff, #80c7f0, #ffffff)
    
    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme1.png">

    The background gradient used is a standard style prevelent throughout early learning environments. Calming and allusive of a clear blue sky the background presents a contrasting perspective for the content of the game area and is not distracting.
    
    <img src="./readme_images/wiggles_background.png">

    _Example of blue-white background gradient in other early-learning media._

     <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme2.png"> #1d5cc9;
     <br>

    * The light blue colored elements of the site contain helpful and informative white text content to guide the user.

    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme3.png"> #ff0000.
    <br>

    * The red color indicates the question button than can be pressed for an audible clue.
    
    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme4.png"> #42526e
    <br>


     * The darker blue colour is used for navigation links. (This color was also featured on the website of St Mary's School so I used it here as it may provide reassurance as a color some users are familiar with)
     
     <br>


     <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme5.png"> #ffff00

    * I tried to avoid using explicit primary and secondary colors as much as possible. This is to avoid any potential confusion for users playing the colours matching game but I made an exeption with yellow as i felt it provided the best contrast and impact for the elements I have targeted with the hover psuedo class.
    
    <br>

    Due to the educational nature of the site and how the content contains multiple vibrant colors I have only included the those used relative to th design of the site framework or those that provide user feedback through consistency of use.


- __Typography__

*  There are two fonts used throughout the site.

    * Schoobell: A fun handwriting novelty font that suits the playful style of the application.
   
    * Helvetica: A clear, professional font is used in the footer developer information and copyright text.

    The fonts were imported to the stylesheet via Google fonts.

    # Testing

- __Testing During Development__
 
* Responsiveness testing 

    
    I tested the responsivness of the application during the development phase using using the following:

    * Promethean Activboard Interactive Whiteboard. (Firefox for Android)
    <img src="./readme_images/promethean1.png">

    * HP Pavillion Notebook x360 serving a
    Smart Technologies SB-480 Interactive Whiteboard.

    * Mac Pro with a 21" Apple Cinema display -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Macbook pro 13" -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Toshiba Satellite Pro Laptop 15" (Windows 10) -- Edge, Chrome and Firefox

    * Apple iPad Mini (5th gen) -- Safari and Chrome
    <img src="./readme_images/ipad_mini.png">

    * Apple iPad (2nd gen -- Safari)
    <img src="./readme_images/old_ipad.png">

    * Huawei P20 Pro Android Phone -- Chrome and Firefox.

    * Various android tablet devices.
    <img src="./readme_images/android_tablet.png">

    I also used Google Dev-tools to test the sites responsivness by emulating the sites appearance across other device screen sizes.

    <img src="./readme_images/dev_tools.png">

    At the time of testing, the site was fully responsive across Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers on all of the above devices with the exeption of the following:

    * The Promethean Activboard would not display box items correctly in the Chromium web browser.

    * The site would not load box images or display correctly on the older iPad2 running ios 9.

    * The site is not practically useable on mobile devices in landscape mode.

    <br>

- __Style Error__

    <img src="./readme_images/android_phone.png">

    One of the first rendering errors i came across was an error that cause the drop shadow filter effect to break on mobile devices.

    After searching for a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65801487/drop-shadow-not-working-properly-on-ios-safari) I fixed this issue by using a box-shadow effect instead.

    <br>

- __Feature Testing__

    I first tested each individual function of the first Nav section of the menu page.

    * Sound Toggle

The Sound Toggle feature of the site threw up a few issues during development. Initially the switch functioned correctly on each page with the default setting of: OFF to enhance user experience. 

A problem arose however when users would navigate to a different page of the site. The Sound Toggle would return to the default OFF position.

Whilst it remains good UX design for default sound settings to be muted when the application first loads, I realised this would become tiresome and lead to a poor user experience if they had to constantly keep changing the switch state to achieve their desired sound setting. 

I found a solution to this problem on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMs0rn6kwM). By storing string data to Local Storage I was able to call a function that set the sound toggle depending on the data contained within Local Storage. I was also able to maintain a default mute position by using the null keyword. 

<img src="./readme_images/dev_tools.png">

I logged the string data from Local Storage to the console using Google Dev Tools to test this function during development. 

Despite this appearing to solve this problem, the console returned another error with the sound toggle as I added more features to the site.

<img src="./readme_images/q_button_error.png">

When I added a fontawesome speaker icon to the question button of each game page (to visual provide feedback for the user), I came across the following error.

<img src="./readme_images/snd_tgl_err1.png">

A problem was reported to the console when users would visit the menu page or about page as the Sound Toggle function would target an element that did not exist on these pages.

<img src="./readme_images/snd_tgl_err2.png">

I resolved this issue by including an element on each page (pictured above) and set the display style property to 'none'

<br>

*  Main Menu Buttons Testing

I had initially intended to have a simple sound function that would play a sound when a click event called it from the DOM. I encountered a problem however when using sounds when loading pages, the pages would often load and clip the sound before it is heard or sometimes it might not be heard at all. 

I fixed this error by developing a function that loads each page only after the sound effect has ended.

* About page Testing

I tested the link to the about page on the menu page and it opened at the correct destination. The About page nav links work, images load and the text content is free from gramattical errors.

* Footer Testing

The footer meets accessibility contrast and title attribute requirements. Both links work and open in a new browser tag. The footer was tested across all site pages.

* Game Page Testing

I encountered and overcame many errors and bugs during the development of the game page.

<br>
    
<img src="./readme_images/typo_error.png">

* Typo Errors

    * The first typo error I encountered provided the question button with the wrong animal type when playing the animals matching game. 
    (pictured above)

    * <img src="./readme_images/typo1_cause.png">

    * I found the offending error in the if else statements of the rungame function and corrected it.

    * The second typo error I found was playing the colours matching game. The Thumbnail image provided no audible user feedback.

    <img src="./readme_images/thumb_blue_error.png">

    * This error was solved by changing the capitalisation error pictured here.

    <br>

- __Test Mode Errors__

I encountered a few tricky errors when the test mode function was applied to the game. 

<img src="./readme_images/maketen_error.png">

* Attempts Error

    * When developing the test mode function of the game I created a rule that when ten attempts had been reached the Test Mode Congratulations Modal Would appear and provide the user with a final score. 

    * The error I discovered via testing was that the Test modal would fire even when the game was not in test mode.

    * I solved this problem by adding a second condition to the "tenCheck" JavaScript Function". (pictured above)

* Error in Shapes Game -- Test Mode
    
    * When developing the test mode function of the shapes game I discovered an error where the game would not refresh the flash card box elements when the test mode function was called.

    * <img src="./readme_images/shapes_test_error.png">

    * I found the issue here was a rougue space in the inner html of the element the JavaScript code was targeting. (facepalm emoji)

    * <img src="./readme_images/shapes_test_solved.png">

    <br>

* Further Testing of The Game Page
    
    * I tested each of the nav elements of every Game Page and each element functions properly.

    * I created the following test sequence for rigorous testing of all box elements across all game categories and modes.

    * The testing sequence is as follows:
        
        * Each box is clicked 10 times (To test for repeat of tenCheck function error)

        * The score will be logged for each box out of 10 in both game modes

        * Question Button and Thumbnail image results will be logged out of forty if they render correctly, match each other and match the correct box image every time.

        * Box Errors and Lower Game section errors will be logged in an errors section underneath the table.

| Thumbnail Image | 40/40   | 40/40  | 40/40   | 40/40        | 40/40       | 40/40        | N/A                   |

The results of sequence testing returned no further errors.

- __Validator Testing__

I ran all of the sites pages through the W3C validator and each page returned multiple errors.

I corrected the code and all four pages now return no html errors.

* The CSS stylesheet was passed through the Jigsaw Validator and returned no errors.

- __Performance Testing__

    I used Lighthouse to check site performance. The site performs well in most areas however the accesibility score was less than optimal.

    I then used the WCAG color contrast checker tool and it returned contrast errors with the deep orange color in the site's color scheme returning a contrast ratio of less than 3.0.

This was addressed by implementing a brighter orange color for text elements and links within the site.

The site now returns just one contrasting error which is associated with the gradient I have used on the site's sub-headings. I have chosen to ignore this contrast warning as the image provided shows there is no visibility issue whatsoever and the error message appears to be simply a limitation of the WCAG's abilities.

The site now achieves a 100% accesibility rating when performance is tested through lighthouse.

- __Other Bug Fixes__

    * On some touchscreen devices an error occurs due to the hover psuedo class which fails to deselect a nav link when a user returns to the previous page via the back arrow.
    
    <br>

    This bug was fixed by the inclusion of the "inactive" class selector and by setting the nav link elements to display=hidden on smaller screen sizes.

- __Content__

    * The navigation section of this site is loosely based on a code snippet named "flex-test" provided to me by my Code Institute mentor Richard Wells.

    * The fade-in effect for the hero image is from this article on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11679567/using-css-for-a-fade-in-effect-on-page-load

    * The Sticky Navigation Menu is derived from snippets of code from this repository: https://github.com/iamshaunjp/CSS-Tips-and-Tricks/blob/04-css-only-dropdown-menu/css-only-dropdown/styles.css

    * The form on the site is inspired by the Code Institute's Coders Coffeehouse code along project.

    * The CSS styling used to hide the labels of the form inputs was derived from this tutorial: https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/

    * All text icons used on the site were sourced from: https://fontawesome.com/search?m=freecom

    * The link to the favicon icon on all four pages is from: https://favicon.io/


- __Thanks__

    * Kasia Boguka: Code Institute Cohort Facilitator.

        Kasia is seemingly always available to chat code and always leaves me feeling more confident about my progress as a developer whenever we talk. I'll never fully understand people who prefer Tea to Coffee but Kasia makes me at least want to try... ;)

    * Richard Wells: Code Institute Mentor.

        Richard's expertise during this project was invaluable and my project benefitted greatly due to his mentorship. 
        Richard was also extremely generous with his time and our online sessions would often overun. For this I am truly grateful.

    * Helen Mill: Code Institute Admissions Executive
    
        I count myself extremely fortunate to have been afforded the opportunity to study with the Code Institute and would like to thank Helen for giving me the chance.

    * Liam Sheridan and Andrew Kelly (Cumasc Gael)
    
        Our wee American adventure many moons ago was hugely enjoyable and I am priveliged to have worked with such outstanding musicians. 

    * Michelle Calikes
    
        I am hugely thankful for the time my wife has afforded me to work on this project. Thank you Michelle from the bottom of my heart.
