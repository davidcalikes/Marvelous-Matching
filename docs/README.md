## Planning & Development


- __Project Inception__

    As far back as I can remember, I have always had a some-what innate, practical understanding of computing and technology. Having worked within the field of Special Education for the last 15 years I often feel and act upon a sense of duty to assist pupils and collegues who are having difficulty operating and integrating assitive technologies.

    Marvelous Matching, was developed in response to the following technical issues within St Mary's Special School: <br> 
    
    1. Software reliant on the defunct adobe flash player is now no longer functional.
    2. A significant number of pupils with physical and learning disabilitiess find most early-learning applications too difficult to interact with.
    3. There are currently no resources available that offer pupils the chance to match multiple categories within a single application.
    4. There are no resources available that are compatible across multiple platforms. 
    
    
    <br>

    
- __Mission Statement__

    A matching game called 'Marvelous Matching' will be developed to address the issues stated above.

    Marvelous Matching will be a user friendly application that is easy to use and navigate.

    The application will be functional across multiple devices, browsers and operating systems. 

    The site will help children achieve thier educational goals by addressing key stage learning outcomes.  
    
    The site will also allow its users to access a stimulating and rewarding library of custom sounds to enhance the users educational experience. 
    
    These sounds will be user controlled and promote interaction and engagement.

    The game will offer users a choice of three separate categories: ‘Animals’, ‘Shapes’, and ‘Colours’ as well as a choice of two game modes: 'Learning' and 'Test'. 
     
- __Target Audience__

    <img src="./readme_images/learning_outcomes.png">

    After consultation with St Mary's Class 5 teacher Caoimhe Brady, we reched the conclusion that matching games are an important resource in helping children of all ages within our school achieve the following (Irish Corriculum) learning outcomes:

    * Sorting & Comparing.
    * Matching Identical Objects.
    * Recognising 'same' and 'different'.
    * Observing 2 dimensional shapes.
    * Recognising irregular shapes (star, oval)
    * Expanding vocabulary. (shape names, colour names, animal, names ect.)
    * Recognising sounds

    <br>

    Whilst the catalyst for the development of Marvelous Matching was due to the exigent needs of the pupils of St Mary's Special School, the site may also prove useful to users outwith special education environments.

    Many parents with young toddlers may also find the application useful for pre-school learning.

<br>

- __Wireframes__ 

    Desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes were created using Balsamiq software to give a general overview of the layout of the site and to help organise the content logically. An image is posted of the gamepage wireframes below. I thought it unnecessary to create a framework for each game as the layout does not change for each categoty. A link to the full set of wireframes is available below.

    * [Set of site wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/home_wf.pdf) 
    
    <br>

   <img src="./readme_images/wireframe_gamepage.png">
   
   <br>
    The site conforms to the general layout of these frames and only deviates with respect to styling and content. 
<br>

- __Color Scheme__

    * The background gradient. (#ffffff, #80c7f0, #ffffff)
    
    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme1.png">

    The background gradient used is a standard style prevelent throughout early learning environments. Calming and allusive of a clear blue sky the background presents a contrasting perspective for the content of the game area and is not distracting.
    
    <img src="./readme_images/wiggles_background.png">

    _Example of blue-white background gradient in other early-learning media._

     <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme2.png"> #1d5cc9;
     <br>

    * The light blue colored elements of the sight contain helpful and informative white text content to guide the user.

    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme3.png"> #FF5349.
    <br>

    * The light orange color indicates the question button than can be pressed for an audible clue. The Color is also used in modal elements to begin the game.
    
    <br>

    <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme4.png"> #42526e
    <br>


     * The darker blue colour is used for navigation links. (This color was also featured on the website of St Mary's School so I used it here as it may provide reassurance as a color some users are familiar with)
     
     <br>


     <img src="./readme_images/color_scheme5.png"> #ffff00

    * I tried to avoid using explicit primary and secondary colors as much as possible. This is to avoid any potential confusion for users playing the colours matching game but I made an exeption with yellow as i felt it provided the best contrast and impact for the elements I have targeted with the hover psuedo class.
    
    <br>






- __Typography__

*  There are three fonts used throughout the site.

    * Quintessential: A cursive font to envoke the band's aesthetic is used for section headings.

    * Raleway: A popular sans serif font often utilised in modern music websites is used for section sub-headings.  
   
    * Helvetica: A clear, complimentary font often partnered with Raleway is used for all other text.

    The fonts were imported to the stylesheet via Google fonts.

    # Testing

- __Testing During Development__
 
    * Testing Technologies 
    
    <br>
    
    I rigorously tested the site during the development phase using using the following:

    
    * Mac Pro with a 21" Apple Cinema display -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Macbook pro 13" -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Toshiba Laptop 15" (Windows 10) -- Edge, Chrome and Firefox

    * Apple iPad Mini (5th gen) -- Safari and Chrome

    * Huawei P20 Pro Android Phone -- Chrome and Firfox

    * Samsung Galaxy Tab 7" -- Chrome

    I also used Google Dev-tools to test the sites responsivity in real time and also emulate the sites appearance and responsivity across several other devices.

<img src="assets/readme_images/dev_tools.png">

- __Testing the Home page__

I tested each individual link on the nav bar on the home page and each link brought me to the correct destination.

I discovered a bug during testing which caused the About and Contact page links to move up one pixel to accomodate the hover class underline animation. I noticed that this was not the case with the nav links on the opposite side. 

This appeared to be because of the assigned "Active class" indacator on the Home page. 

I fixed this bug using CSS and a class selector called "Inactive Class" on the opposite side. 

I will continue to look for an alternative solution to this problem as the development of the site continues.

I tested each link of the Sticky Nav Feature and found no errors.

I then tested each link on the Upcoming Dates section.

Each link opened in a new tab and to the correct URL.

Each link in the News section was then tested and one link was found to be missing a blank_ attribute value. 

This error was subsequently fixed.

I checked the spelling and grammar of the text content in this section and found no errors.

I tested the form element of this page and it functioned correctly.

Each of the footer links was checked and returned no errors.

- __Testing the Media page__

I tested each individual link on the nav bar on the Media page and each link brought me to the correct destination.

I tested each link of the Sticky Nav Feature and found no errors.

I then tested the playback for both tracks on the audio section.

The Audio Section functions correctly however, a limitation of the embedded audio player means that users must stop one track before playing another one. This is not an optimal user experience and I will look for better solutions to this issue as I continue the development of the site. 

I tested the video in the video section of the site and the content displayed correctly.

Each of the Gallery images loaded correctly.

I checked the spelling and grammar of the text content in this section and found no errors.

I tested the form element of this page and it functioned correctly.

Each of the footer links was checked and returned no errors.

- __Testing the About page__

I tested each individual link on the nav bar on the About page and each link brought me to the correct destination.

I tested each link of the Sticky Nav Feature and found no errors.

I then tested the link on the lower-bio section and it functioned correctly.

I checked the spelling and grammar of the text content in this section and found no errors.

I tested the form element of this page and it functioned correctly.

Each of the footer links was checked and returned no errors.

- __Testing the Contact page__

I tested each individual link on the nav bar on the Contact page and each link brought me to the correct destination.

I tested each link of the Sticky Nav Feature and found no errors.

I then tested the email links on the contact section and there were no errors returned.

I checked the spelling and grammar of the text content in this section and found no errors.

I tested the form element of this page and it functioned correctly.

Each of the footer links was checked and returned no errors.

- __Validator Testing__

I ran all of the sites pages through the W3C validator and each page returned multiple errors.

<img src="assets/readme_images/validation_errors.png">

I corrected the code and all four pages now return no html errors.

<img src="assets/readme_images/no_errors.png">

* The CSS stylesheet was passed through the Jigsaw Validator and returned no errors.

<img src="assets/readme_images/css_val.png">

<br>


- __Performance Testing__

    I used Lighthouse to check site performance. The site performs well in most areas however the accesibility score was less than optimal.

    I then used the WCAG color contrast checker tool and it returned contrast errors with the deep orange color in the site's color scheme returning a contrast ratio of less than 3.0.

<img src="assets/readme_images/test_aa.png">

This was addressed by implementing a brighter orange color for text elements and links within the site. 

<img src="assets/readme_images/test_contrast.png">

The site now returns just one contrasting error which is associated with the gradient I have used on the site's sub-headings. I have chosen to ignore this contrast warning as the image provided shows there is no visibility issue whatsoever and the error message appears to be simply a limitation of the WCAG's abilities.

<img src="assets/readme_images/limit.png">

The site now achieves a 100% accesibility rating when performance is tested through lighthouse.

<img src="assets/readme_images/lighthouse.png">

<br>

- __Other Bug Fixes__

    * On some touchscreen devices an error occurs due to the hover psuedo class which fails to deselect a nav link when a user returns to the previous page via the back arrow.
    
    <br>

    This bug was fixed by the inclusion of the "inactive" class selector and by setting the nav link elements to display=hidden on smaller screen sizes. 
    
    <br>


     <img src="assets/readme_images/bug.png">



<br>

- __Unfixed Bugs__
 
 Although there are no known bugs present within the site, I have left this section of the README file for cataloguing and fixing future bugs.
